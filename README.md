The IPR, short for *Internal Program Representation*, is an open source
project originally developed as the core data structures of a framework
for semantics-based analysis and transformation of C++ programs.  The
foundations of the IPR were laid down and implemented between 2004 and
2005, as part of The Pivot research project.  An overview, the
general philosophy, and the design principles behind the IPR are
presented in the paper ["A Principled, Complete, and Efficient
Representation of C++"](http://www.axiomatics.org/~gdr/ipr/mcs.pdf).
That paper is a useful source of general information about the IPR
and non-obvious challenges in representing C++ programs in their most
general forms.
