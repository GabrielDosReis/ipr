# Coding Style

Use good judgment, and taste. Appreciate simplicity.

In absence of the above, consider the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines).

## Logical connectives

Use:
  - `not` for logical negation
  - `and` for logical conjunction
  - `or` for logical disjunction


## Factory function names

Use:
  - `get_xxx` for factory function names that return the same output for same inputs
  - `make_xxx` for factory function names that always return fresh structures


## Source file extensions

Use
  - `.cxx` for implementation source files
