IPR is using CMake as its build system. The default configuration will
build the library and the tests. The tests can be invoked using the test
target:

> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> make test

Or alternatively, tests can be invoked using CTest:
> ctest

The Latex documentation is also optional. The BUILD_DOC CMake option enables
building the documentation. It required pdflatex to be available in the path.
The documentation can be built using the doc target.

> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DBUILD_DOC=ON
> make doc
