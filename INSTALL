IPR is using CMake as its build system. The default configuration will
build the library:

> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake ..
> make

Tests need to be enabled explicitly using the BUILD_TESTING CMake option.
IPR is using GTest as its unit testing framework. When GTest is not found
at configuration time the CMake script will download and build it automatically.
After enabling testing tests will be built automatically when building the
default target. The DOWNLOAD_GTEST CMake option can be used to force downloading
GTest over using the one installed on the system.

> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
> make

Tests can be run using the test target.

> make test

The Latex documentation is also optional. The BUILD_DOC CMake option enables
building the documentation. It required pdflatex to be available in the path.
The documentation can be built using the doc target.

> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DBUILD_DOC=ON
> make doc
