   // C++ constructs span locations.  There are at least four flavours of
   // locations:
   //       (a) physical source location;
   //       (b) logical source location;
   //       (c) physical unit location; and
   //       (d) logical unit location.
   // Physical and logical source locations are locations as witnessed
   // at translation phase 2 (see ISO C++, ยง2.1/1).
   // Physical and logical unit locations are locations as manifest when
   // looking at a translation unit, at translation phase 4.

   // Many IPR nodes will have a source and unit locations.  Instead of
   // storing a source file and unit name as a string in every
   // location data type, we save space by mapping file-names and
   // unit-names to IDs (integers).  That mapping is managed by the Unit
   // instance.
